I'm an AI researcher and developer trying to make a safer cyber world every day. 

Currently I'm researching deepfake detection at Rochester Institute of Technology with the intent to pursue a PhD after I graduate.

My primary languages and toolchains involve Python, C/C++, PyTorch, Tensorflow/Keras, and recently React.
